## Who is Estopa?
 
Estopa was born in CornellÃ  de Llobregat, a suburb of Barcelona, in 1978 and 1979 respectively. They grew up listening to rock bands like AC/DC, Extremoduro and Platero y TÃº, as well as flamenco artists like CamarÃ³n de la Isla and Paco de LucÃ­a. They started playing guitar and singing together as teenagers, and formed Estopa in 1999.
 
Their name comes from the Spanish word for tow, the material used to make wicks for oil lamps. It was also a slang term for low-quality hashish, which they used to smoke. Their first album, Estopa, was a huge success in Spain, selling over a million copies and spawning hits like "La Raja de tu Falda" and "Como CamarÃ³n". They soon became one of the most popular and influential bands in the Spanish music scene.
 
Since then, they have released eight more albums, each with a different sound and style. They have collaborated with artists like Rosario, Macaco, El Canto del Loco and Los Chichos. They have won several awards, including two Ondas Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award and a Premio de la MÃºsica. They have also performed in many countries around the world, such as Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and the United States.
